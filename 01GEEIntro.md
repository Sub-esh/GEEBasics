# Introduction to GEE

A cloud-based platform for petabyte-scale geospatial datasets and analysis. This means you can access and process hundreds of different kinds of planetary-datasets according to your requirements using just a web-browser.
All of this is available for free for non-profit and educational purposes. 
Wether it is Land-Use land-Classification(LULC), Surface Temperature changes or surface water changes over time, complex analyses of large-scale data in a few line of codes and a very short time is made possible with the use of GEE.
